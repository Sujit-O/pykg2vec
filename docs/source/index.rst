Welcome to pykg2vec documentation!

Pykg2vec is a Tensorflow-based library, currently in active development, for learning the representation of
entities and relations in Knowledge Graphs. We have attempted to bring all the state-of-the-art knowledge
graph embedding algorithms and the necessary building blocks including the whole pipeline into a single
library. We hope Pykg2vec is both practical and educational to users who hope to explore the related fields.
